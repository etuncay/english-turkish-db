This dictionary template may serve as a starter for producing a FreeDict dictionary.
It has been created as part of the didactic materials for the purpose of a two-day 
seminar at the Institute for Interdisciplinary Studies “Artes Librales” (IBI AL) 
at the University of Warsaw, on "XML for linguists/lexicographers", taught by 
Piotr Bański in November/December 2010.

In order to create a new dictionary, copy this directory (without the .svn/ subdirectory),
and rename "lg1-lg2" in both the directory name, the name of the sample dictionary
database ("lg1-lg2.tei"), AND the appropriate fragment of the Makefile. Use the 
ISO 639-3 language codes, available from http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/codes.asp

If you put your new directory at the same level as the other FreeDict directories, you
should be able to "make dist" to wrap up your dictionary into a tar bundle and submit 
it to FreeDict. Look for the bundle under the releases/ subdirectory (not present in 
the SVN -- it is generated by the makefile system).
