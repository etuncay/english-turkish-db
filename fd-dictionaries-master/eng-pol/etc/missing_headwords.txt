TEI-FreeDict version of the English-Polish dictionary by Tadeusz Piotrowski and Zygmunt Saloni.

See: https://github.com/freedict/fd-dictionaries/tree/master/eng-pol

This is a list of missing headwords, i.e. headwords present in the TeX version of the 
dictionary and absent from the SGML version. It was derived by Radek Moszczyński by 
first generating the list of all headwords from the TeX version and diffing it against 
the list derived from the SGML version. As Marcin Woliński remarked in an e-mail 
conversation, the reason for this gap is that the Perl/Prolog converted used to create 
the SGML representation would break on complicated entries and that possibly, those entries 
have been converted manually. (But even if they have, they aren't part of this release.)

This list reflects the state of affairs of May 2011. Volunteers wishing to help convert the 
missing headwords are warmly welcome -- please e-mail the project list or one of the project 
administrators, e.g. bansp in-domain o2.pl.
