This is the content of the notes that I have made during 
the conversion of the GPL-ed English - Polish dictionary by  
Tadeusz Piotrowski and Zygmunt Saloni (1992). 

Unfortunately, I am not able to locate the XSL script that I used
to transduce SGML into TEI XML. It had SO many comments inside...
If I ever find it in the vastness of my backups and the mess of 
my subsequent disks, I will roll another tarball of this release (0.1).

=====================
Unstructured fragments of my notes follow.


Latin2: everything.

for G in *.sgml; do iconv -f LATIN2 -t UTF-8 <$G >$G.xml; done


Generate a .dtd

Replace XBDICT with xbdict, add the XML prolog.

&eacute; with é

&ecirc; with ê

&acirc; with â

&iuml; with ï

&egrave; with è

Added spellings without these diacritics (around 40 additions)

    <spl>pâté</spl>
    <spl>pate</spl>

Adjusted matinée, negligée, séance, soufflé, naïve (they were preceded by the diacritic-less form; I want to always index entries by the last orth, without introducing checks in the loop).

Split protégé/protégée to make them analogical to fiancé/fiancée (noting the difference in the POS: protégé/protégée is Adj, fiancé is N).

Potential danger for indexing, will probably have to index by hand here: 

    <spl>rosé</spl>
    <spl>rose</spl>

Pronunciation changes:

ei --> eɪ (2187 replacements);
ai --> aɪ (1650 replacements);
oi --> ɔɪ (149)
e{\e} --> ɛə (251)
u: 1048 (hmm, why is it 1042 later? check!!!!)
ou --> əʊ (1332)
{\e}: --> ɜ: (721)
{t} --> ɑ (829)

o: --> ɔ:(1052)
{\o} --> æ (2456)

for \cdot, I chose the "dot operator" $sdot; ⋅ (420 replacements)
for the accompanying $, I chose non-breaking-space  &nbsp; ( ).

 
{\n} --> ŋ (1086)

{\a} --> ʌ (1507)

d{\z} --> ʤ (847)
{\z} --> ʒ (101)
t{\s} --> ʧ (550)
{\s} --> ʃ (1477)


{\q} --> θ (393)
{\h} --> ð (150)

{\`} --> ˈ (13762)
{\,} --> ˌ (2198)

{\e} --> ə (10347)

au --> aʊ (421)
u --> ʊ (670)


(<phonetic>.*)i(.*<)
i --> ɪ (8169+2180+405+62+5)
o --> ɒ (1629+21)

(for the sake of completeness: u: - 1042; i: - 1259)

number of <phonetic> elements: 16334; some of them should be split around ", " (for variants)


careful here:

 <spl>aesthetic</spl>
    <spl>esthetic</spl>
    <lang>US</lang>

(encoding by position, nasty)
